# Master Rules

The following rules have priority over ALL other rules:

- ALWAYS write TSDoc comments FOR AND ONLY FOR exported functions, classes, and public methods;
- NEVER write any other comments/logs UNLESS explicitly requested;
- Treat `context7:*` MCP as the authoritative source of documentation for any dependency;
- ALWAYS use `exa:*` MCP WHEN you need to search the web;
- ALWAYS respond in French.
